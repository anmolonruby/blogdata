Check out our new "Agile Evolved":http://www.agileevolved.com business cards which arrived today, just in time for RailsConf.

They look really cool. They were printed by "Aubergine Print":http://aubergineprint.co.uk/. Our "new logo":http://lukeredpath.co.uk/assets/2006/9/8/agileevolved_logo.jpg was designed by "Tokyo Cube":http://www.tokyocube.com/. Mine haven't arrived yet, but when they do I'll update the above photo with something a bit more high-quality (theres only so much you can do in Photoshop to improve a camera phone picture).

There will hopefully be many of these being handed out at next week's "European RailsConf":http://europe.railsconf.org/.
