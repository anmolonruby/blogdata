Apologies for the long delay between this and the last post -- I've struggled to find the time to post anything of late although I hope to rectify that in the coming months. In the meantime, you'll have to make do with a blatant advertisement.

As the title says, I'm selling my two year old MacBook Pro to make way for a more recent, but more portable black MacBook. It was my first Mac and it's served me well over the years; it's still a great machine, I'm just in the market for something smaller with a little more oomph. Here are the pertinent details:

* Rev. A MacBook Pro (March 2006)
* 1.83 Ghz Core Duo processor
* 1.5GB RAM
* 80GB Hard Drive
* SuperDrive
* Comes with original box and packaging, accessories and Tiger install CD
* I can ship it with Leopard pre-installed if you so wish

It's well used and has a few battle scars but nothing serious and is otherwise good condition and in perfect working order. The wireless problems that I mentioned in a previous blog post seem to have gone away since the latest Leopard update (so I guess it was a software issue after all) and there are no other issues with the machine.

So if you're looking to hook yourself up with a great value laptop which is perfect for Ruby/Rails development you can "bid on the item on my eBay auction":http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=140205481385&_trksid=p3907.m32&_trkparms=tab%3DSelling or alternatively, take it straight off of my hands without going through eBay for £650 + shipping costs (£20, Royal Mail special delivery) by dropping me an e-mail - there is a contact link at the top of the page. If you are based in London, I'm also happy for you to collect it. See the eBay auction page for full details and some photos and don't hesitate to e-mail me with any questions.
