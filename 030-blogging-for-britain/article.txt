An "interesting article":http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6048392.stm dropped into my newsreader this morning. The "National Trust":http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ are organising what they hope to be "Britain's biggest blog" by encouraging people to blog about a normal day living in Britain. The blog entries will then be archived and stored in the "British Library":http://www.bl.uk/ amongst other places.

As a relatively new blogger (this blog is my fourth attempt at getting a blog going and has been up and running since May this year), I've tried to avoid blogging about the mundane day-to-day aspects of life but I have to admit that this sounds like an intriguing idea that I'd really like to have a go at.

If you live in the UK and you'd like to take part yourself, entries can be uploaded between 17 - 31 October on the "History Matters":http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/page96.asp website. It doesn't have to be more than 650 words long. I'll be picking a day in the coming fortnight to give it a go (hopefully an interesting day!) and I'll post my entry up on here too.

Go on, "blog for Britain!":http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/page96.asp
