What if...you could produce accessible, unobtrusive javascript, using Rails built-in javascript/prototype helpers, with just one extra line of code in your layout, a plugin, and one small enhancement to the helpers? Something like this:

<filter:jscode lang="ruby">
&lt% form_remote_tag :controller => 'foo', :action => 'bar', :unobtrusive => true %&gt
</filter:jscode>

Which produces:

<filter:jscode lang="ruby">
&lt;form id="form_foo_bar" action="/foo/bar" method="post"&gt;
</filter:jscode>

But which still acts as an ajax form? You would simply handle the response for ajax and non ajax requests using Rails' responds_to function.

In addition, what if you could attach javascript functionality to your page elements in a Behaviour-like fashion, but using pure Ruby, anywhere in your view, but loaded from an external Javascript file?

Sorry to tease. Stay tuned, we have something very cool to show off in the next day or two.
