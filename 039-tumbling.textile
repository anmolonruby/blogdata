Since I started blogging again a few months ago, I thought it would be a good idea to set up a tumblelog (courtesy of "tumblr":http://tumblr.com) to encourage me to post more frequently without having to spend time writing full-length blog entries.

In case you missed new navigation bar along the top of this blog (or you are reading this in your newsreader), then you can access "my tumblelog here":http://tumble.lukeredpath.co.uk.

Besides the obligatory tumblelog fare (quotes, chat excerpts and so on) I tend to post any useful, interesting or plain esoteric code snippets that I have written or come across, so please do check it out. You can also "subscribe to the feed":http://feeds.feedburner.com/tumble-lukeredpath.

Here are some recent snippets:

 * "Timeout on any Ruby method":http://tumble.lukeredpath.co.uk/post/12847007
 * "More sneaky #to_proc tricks":http://tumble.lukeredpath.co.uk/post/11530172

On an unrelated note, I did attend RailsConf Europe last week but have yet to finish my write-up. To everybody I got the chance to talk to while I was out in Berlin, it was good catching up and enjoy numerous beers. I have to say thanks to my employers, "Reevoo":http://www.reevoo.com for financing the trip. There were some interesting talks and I enjoyed myself overall but unfortunately were also some disappointments - more on that in my full write-up.
