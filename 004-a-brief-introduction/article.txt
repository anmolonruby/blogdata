I'm not great at introductions so I'll try and keep this short and sweet. My name's Luke Redpath and I'm a developer from London, UK. I'm the Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.agileevolved.com">Agile Evolved</a>

As part of my job I get to work almost exclusively with RubyOnRails, something I will post about frequently on my blog. I'll be sharing Rails tips and opinions and we have some interesting Rails plugins under development - more about that soon.

I'm also a <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums">SitePoint</a> mentor and you can find me posting frequently in the Ruby, PHP Application Design and General Development forums.
